# Race Strategy Software
This software is designed to take inputs from both the car and other sources to predict the optimal speed the car should travel at during a race.

## Setup
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all necessary python packages

## Usage
- To run the lap simulator, navigate to the `lapsim` directory and run `$ python3 lapsim.py`
- To run the lap simulator with the Flask server, navigate to the `lapsim` directory and run `$ ./lapsim.sh`

- If you find a bug in the software or believe an additional feature would be useful, please submit an issue ticket describing the problem.
- If you are making a change to the repo (eg. fixing a bug or adding a feature), fix the feature on a new branch with a descriptive name and open a pull request into the `master` branch (See rules below). 

## Rules
- Have fun.
- Create a Pull Request whenever you are ready to add your working code to the master branch. 
- You must select at least one reviewer for approval.

## Notes
- This README is not comprehensive, since I wrote most of it within 2 hours of seeing the code for the first time
- As we restart development of this project, we will need to update this README
